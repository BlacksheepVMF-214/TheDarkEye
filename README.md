A project for a dice-rolling application for The Dark Eye (Das Schwarze Auge) German RPG. 
This is currently a web-based program, but the eventual plan is to be a stand-alone mobile application.

I would like for the d20 dice results to appear on triangular backgrounds (mimicing a d20 face); each die should have a user-configurable color. To start, the three colors should be black, red, and gold, a la the German flag.

The user will pick the skill and enter the penalty, then either click/tap ROLL! or enter his own die rolls and click/tap CALC!.
